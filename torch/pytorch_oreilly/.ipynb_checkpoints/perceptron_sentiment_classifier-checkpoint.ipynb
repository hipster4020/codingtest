n nunfortunately the carpet was just the beginning . we performed our pre move in inspection , which of course we weren t even allowed into the apartment before we were given keys after signing our lease . we were completely led to believe we would be receiving a place comparable at leaset to the apartment we were shown , but the inspection list became a novel of dilapidation . the microwave didn t work , which means the grease vent over the stove didn t work either . the faucet on the sink leaked water everywhere . the shelves in the pantry were broken and lying on the floor . their was a handle missing from the wet bar sink , there were cigarette burns on the counters on the bathrooms . n nafter reporting all of these things , we were told that maintenance is too backed up right now , and you d get to it soon . i believe that if maintenance is too busy to prepare apartments properly for move in , then you are too busy to be renting any new apartments . do you agree ? n ni demanded that maintenance come immediately to fix everything , and it began one of visits to perform simple repairs . the first guy to come was named rick , and he informed me that my microwave couldn t be fixed , and he needed to order a new one and it would take one week , and he would fix the rest when he brought the new unit in . after weeks i came back to the office to complain about this and i had a new maintenance person show up who couldn t read english . i know this , because he asked me to read the work order to him . he then proceeded to take apart the microwave to fix it . he also decided it couldn t be fixed and told me he would order a new one . i informed him that one should have already been ordered , but he told me that it was not . n nthe following week rick returned and informed me that the microwave had been ready for weeks . he had no reason for not installing it when it came in , just a shrug and a confused look when i asked . he tried for about minutes to install the microwave before telling me he needed to leave and get new tools . after minutes past without him returning i installed it myself . he returned to take his tools back about an hour later . do you think it s reasonable for tenants to have to install their own appliances ? how do you ensure that your maintenance is competent to do simple tasks like this ? n ni was told that the handle on the sink couldn t be replaced , and i would just have to deal with only having the hot handle on the sink . rick replaced the faucet in the kitchen that was leaking water , and told me he couldn t figure out why all the red and blue temperature caps on the knobs are always backwards . i figured it out when he left , since the sink was still leaking . he put in on backwards , and since they always put them on backwards , it tells me he installs all of them backwards . does this sound like competent maintenance ? is it reasonable for a tenant to need to reinstall a faucet that your people installed backwards ? n ni eventually fixed the shelves in the pantry myself , and refused to call maintenance again until my ancient fridge quit working and let all my food spoil over the weekend while i was out of town . when i got back and threw away all of my spoiled food , i called maintenance and was told that the fridge seemed to be working again , and they wouldn t replace it unless it was broken when they inspected it . do you think it s reasonable for a tenant to keep a fridge that has already cost them over a hundred dollars in spoiled food ?

n nunfortunately the carpet was just the beginning . we performed our pre move in inspection , which of course we weren t even allowed into the apartment before we were given keys after signing our lease . we were completely led to believe we would be receiving a place comparable at leaset to the apartment we were shown , but the inspection list became a novel of dilapidation . the microwave didn t work , which means the grease vent over the stove didn t work either . the faucet on the sink leaked water everywhere . the shelves in the pantry were broken and lying on the floor . their was a handle missing from the wet bar sink , there were cigarette burns on the counters on the bathrooms . n nafter reporting all of these things , we were told that maintenance is too backed up right now , and you d get to it soon . i believe that if maintenance is too busy to prepare apartments properly for move in , then you are too busy to be renting any new apartments . do you agree ? n ni demanded that maintenance come immediately to fix everything , and it began one of visits to perform simple repairs . the first guy to come was named rick , and he informed me that my microwave couldn t be fixed , and he needed to order a new one and it would take one week , and he would fix the rest when he brought the new unit in . after weeks i came back to the office to complain about this and i had a new maintenance person show up who couldn t read english . i know this , because he asked me to read the work order to him . he then proceeded to take apart the microwave to fix it . he also decided it couldn t be fixed and told me he would order a new one . i informed him that one should have already been ordered , but he told me that it was not . n nthe following week rick returned and informed me that the microwave had been ready for weeks . he had no reason for not installing it when it came in , just a shrug and a confused look when i asked . he tried for about minutes to install the microwave before telling me he needed to leave and get new tools . after minutes past without him returning i installed it myself . he returned to take his tools back about an hour later . do you think it s reasonable for tenants to have to install their own appliances ? how do you ensure that your maintenance is competent to do simple tasks like this ? n ni was told that the handle on the sink couldn t be replaced , and i would just have to deal with only having the hot handle on the sink . rick replaced the faucet in the kitchen that was leaking water , and told me he couldn t figure out why all the red and blue temperature caps on the knobs are always backwards . i figured it out when he left , since the sink was still leaking . he put in on backwards , and since they always put them on backwards , it tells me he installs all of them backwards . does this sound like competent maintenance ? is it reasonable for a tenant to need to reinstall a faucet that your people installed backwards ? n ni eventually fixed the shelves in the pantry myself , and refused to call maintenance again until my ancient fridge quit working and let all my food spoil over the weekend while i was out of town . when i got back and threw away all of my spoiled food , i called maintenance and was told that the fridge seemed to be working again , and they wouldn t replace it unless it was broken when they inspected it . do you think it s reasonable for a tenant to keep a fridge that has already cost them over a hundred dollars in spoiled food ? i demanded a new unit , and eventually they complied . n nas for the grounds , i was told the pools and weight room were hours when i moved in . i ve since seen that they are often locked up without any sign of why they are closed .
